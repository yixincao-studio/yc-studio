            <p> Environment pollution is happening on our
                earth home. I took some inspiration from photographer Alberto Seveso, who
                captured clouds of ink underwater. Therefore, I decided to use ink rendering is a
                metaphor for air chemical pollution. I injected the acrylic paint into the water with a
                syringe needle. The acrylic paint like clouds in the water, slowly covered the village,
                the woods, giving a sense of suffocation.
                About this ink rendering projection, could capture the audience's interaction
                and move their feelings. There is the collision of two primary colours of yellow and
                blue, and the fusion of complementary colours of yellow and purple. In addition, the
                mixture of colours creates a chaotic atmosphere that covers the houses and woods
                like human beings surrounded by chemical gases. People use more natural
                resources, the earth will wear out faster, and our homeland will disappear in future. I
                hope that this project of my art will bring people to think about the ecological
                environment needs in future.</p>
