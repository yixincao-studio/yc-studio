        <p>t was unremittingly hot at the farm in Natick, Massachusetts, where 1,500 people had gathered on the Sunday
            after the
            Fourth of July. Remarkably, this crowd had assembled under a blistering sun not for a free concert, or
            outdoor theater,
            or even a protest, exactly. They’d come for an open-air town hall with their sitting senator, a 69-year-old
            woman widely
            expected to win reelection to her second term this fall. Standing at the back of the sweaty throng, I’d seen
            her
            introduced from the stage, then heard cheers greeting her entrance, but couldn’t for the life of me lay eyes
            on her. Not
            until I climbed onto the seat of my folding chair in the press section. There she was, jogging 75 yards down
            a hill in
            open-toed mules, her aqua cardigan flying behind her.

            Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is in constant motion. She often takes stages at a run, zigzagging
            around the
            edges of crowds, waving and giving high fives like Bruce Springsteen. Speaking to groups of supporters, she
            rocks on her
            feet, or rises to her tiptoes, with feeling; occasionally she tucks her mic under her arm to clap for
            herself or cuts
            the air in front of her with her flat palm. She’ll beat her chest for emphasis, speak so passionately that
            she gets
            winded, and throw a fist in the air as a symbol of defiance and determination. One afternoon in Nevada,
            perched on a
            punishingly high stool in front of several hundred people at a brewery, she kicked her feet out in front of
            her with
            such force that I feared she’d tip over backward.</p>
